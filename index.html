            Just as one size does not fit all, it is obvious that what may work for some as far as diet and exercise plans go may not
            work well for others. It is my job to find the wellness plan best designed to help you attain your goals holistically.
            I specialize in encouraging lifestyle changes not quick fixes. Together, we will identify goals, uncover obstacles
            and develop strategies to overcome them.

            Daily coaching, along with individualized workout and nutritional plans will enable you to attain your health and fitness
            goals. Daily workouts may include but are not limited to weight training, cardio kickboxing, pilates, yoga, tai
            chi or even a little Zumba. It is my belief that it is never too late, you are never too old, too young or too
            out of shape to begin a healthy lifestyle change. There is ALWAYS hope. As your coach, I will be with you every
            step of the way whether it is by phone, text, email, Skype or FaceTime.

            The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported corporations that implemented physical fitness activities had a
            reduction in healthcare costs by 20 to 55 percent. Short term sick leaves were reduced up to 32 percent while
            productivity increased up to 52 percent. Benefits for employees engaged in worksite wellness programs may include
            lower stress levels, increased stamina, well-being and self-esteem. Through daily, bi-weekly or weekly coaching
            and training, employees who participate will develop healthy life-long positive habits to ensure quality of life.

              <p>It has been my pleasure to work with various trainers, nutritionists and coaches over the years. There was
                only one who was "the complete package" and that was Stephanie. My workouts were specifically tailored for
                the goals we established and each one thoughtfully developed. Stephanie had a unique gift to motivate you
                in ways that were both encouraging and tough. I have struggled to keep my strength up and my weight down
                since she moved to California. Michigan's loss was California's gain. A person's life is blessed with Stephanie
                as your coach.</p>

                my needs. Her knowledge and expertise was widely spread over many different areas of physical fitness. I

              <p>Stephanie has been our personal fitness coach and nutrition consultant for the last four years. She has
                been kind and patient and has worked with the crazy schedules of myself and my teen/young adult daughters.
                Stephanie's encouragement, and her professionalism make her our favorite personal coach. She has so many
                resources, and areas of well-being expertise, and has really helped to guide the health and fitness choices
                we have been able to make as a family. I can't recommend her highly enough - she has the compassion of a
                favorite aunt, and the whip-cracking of a drill sergeant, rolled into one.</p>
