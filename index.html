              Just as one size does not fit all, it is obvious that what may
              work for some as far as diet and exercise plans go may not work
              well for others. It is my job to find the wellness plan best
              designed to help you attain your goals holistically. I specialize
              in encouraging lifestyle changes not quick fixes. Together, we
              will identify goals, uncover obstacles and develop strategies to
              overcome them.

              Daily coaching, along with individualized workout and nutritional
              plans will enable you to attain your health and fitness goals.
              Daily workouts may include but are not limited to weight training,
              cardio kickboxing, pilates, yoga, tai chi or even a little Zumba.
              It is my belief that it is never too late, you are never too old,
              too young or too out of shape to begin a healthy lifestyle change.
              There is ALWAYS hope. As your coach, I will be with you every step
              of the way whether it is by phone, text, email, Skype or FaceTime.

                  It has been my pleasure to work with various trainers,
                  nutritionists and coaches over the years. There was only one
                  who was "the complete package" and that was Stephanie. My
                  workouts were specifically tailored for the goals we
                  established and each one thoughtfully developed. Stephanie had
                  a unique gift to motivate you in ways that were both
                  encouraging and tough. I have struggled to keep my strength up
                  and my weight down since she moved to California. Michigan's
                  loss was California's gain. A person's life is blessed with
                  Stephanie as your coach.

                  Stephanie is a great personal trainer. She is reliable,
                  compassionate and tailored each workout to meet my needs. Her
                  knowledge and expertise was widely spread over many different
                  areas of physical fitness. I would highly recommend her to
                  anyone needing a trainer no matter where you are in your
                  fitness or weight loss journey.

                  Stephanie has been our personal fitness coach and nutrition
                  consultant for the last four years. She has been kind and
                  patient and has worked with the crazy schedules of myself and
                  my teen/young adult daughters. Stephanie's encouragement, and
                  her professionalism make her our favorite personal coach. She
                  has so many resources, and areas of well-being expertise, and
                  has really helped to guide the health and fitness choices we
                  have been able to make as a family. I can't recommend her
                  highly enough - she has the compassion of a favorite aunt, and
                  the whip-cracking of a drill sergeant, rolled into one.
